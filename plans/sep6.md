## SEP-6 withdraw and deposit

Deposit and withdraw share a good number of steps and Transferresponse shapes,
meaning most of the API can be consistent across both.

The high-level flow is:

- Fetch supported assets
- User picks deposit/withdrawal type, provides amount/destination
  - Fetch/calculate final fee
- Submit request, and depending on the response:
  - if KYC
    - if manual
      - Redirect to KYC form
      - User submits KYC info
      - Redirect back to wallet
      - (go to "if ok")
    - if automatic
      - ([SEP-12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md)
        is still TODO)
    - if pending
      - "KYC is pending, we're checking for updates"
      - link to more info if available
    - if denied
      - "KYC failed"
      - link to more info if available
  - if ok
    - Display how for deposits, submit transaction to the network for
      withdrawals

### Usage

```js
import { startWithdrawal, startDeposit, RESPONSE_TYPES } from "wallet-sdk";

const withdrawProvider = new WithdrawProvider(transferServerUrl);
const depositProvider = new DepositProvider(transferServerUrl);

// Retrieve supported assets. Used to display options to the user, including
// things like simple fees, asset codes, and withdrawal types.
await withdrawProvider.fetchSupportedAssets();
await depositProvider.fetchSupportedAssets();

// Returns a single number of how much the user will pay, in units of the asset
fee = await withdrawProvider.fetchFinalFee({
  assetCode,
  amount,
  type,
});
fee = await depositProvider.fetchFinalFee({
  assetCode,
  amount,
  type,
});

/**
 * Deposit just needs to display information to the user for them to complete on
 * their own, but withdraw needs to actually submit a transaction, so the code
 * paths are a little bit different.
 */
const depositResult = await depositProvider.deposit({
  asset,
  destination,
  etc,
});
const withdrawResult = await withdrawProvider.withdraw({
  asset,
  destination,
  etc,
});

switch (depositResult.type /* or withdrawResult */) {
  case RESPONSE_TYPES.ok:
    // if deposit
    showUser(depositResult);

    // if withdraw, need to sign/submit transaction
    // (submitPayment is a placeholder function)
    submitPayment({
      memo: withdrawResult.memo,
      destination: withdrawResult.accountId,
      amount,
    });
    break;
  case RESPONSE_TYPES.interactiveKyc:
    if (isBrowser) {
      // To avoid popup blockers, the new window has to be opened directly in
      // response to a user click event, so we need consumers to provide us a
      // window instance that they created previously. This could also be done in
      // an iframe or something.
      const popup = window.open("", "name", "dimensions etc");

      const kycResult = await withdrawProvider.fetchKycInBrowser({
        response: withdrawResult,
        window: popup,
      });

      // if deposit
      showUser(kycResult);

      // if withdraw, need to sign/submit transaction
      // (submitPayment is a placeholder function)
      submitPayment({
        memo: kycResult.memo,
        destination: kycResult.accountId,
        amount,
      });
    } else if (isServerEnv || isNativeEnv) {
      const kycRedirect = getKycUrl({
        result: withdrawResult,
        request: withdrawRequest,
        callbackUrl,
      });
      /**
       * On e.g. react native, the client will have to open a webview manually
       * and pass a callback URL that the app has "claimed." This is very similar
       * to e.g. OAuth flows.
       * https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/redirect-uris-native-apps/
       * Include the original request so it can be provided as a querystring to
       * the callback URL. Simplifies re-submission dramatically after receiving
       * KYC results.
       */
    }
    break;
  case RESPONSE_TYPES.nonInteractiveKyc:
    // TODO: SEP-12 data submission
