/**
 * WithdrawProvider provides methods to interact with a transfer server. At a
 * high level, you'll need to:
 * - Fetch the supported assets.
 * - Collect information from the user.
 * - Confirm the withdrawal/show them how much fee they'll pay.
 * - Start the withdrawal.
 *  - If KYC is needed, you'll have to do some additional logic.
 *
 * ```js
 * const withdrawProvider = new WithdrawProvider(transferServerUrl);
 * const asset = await withdrawProvider.fetchSupportedAssets();
 *
 * // user provides information, picks asset
 *
 * const fee = await withdrawProvider.fetchFinalFee({
 *   assetCode,
 *   amount,
 *   type,
 * });
 *
 * // show fee to user, confirm amount and destination
 *
 * const withdrawResult = await withdrawProvider.withdraw({
 *   type
 *   assetCode,
 *   dest,
 *   // more optional properties
 * });
 *
 * // We've gotten a result, but it might be one of several types.
 * switch (withdrawResult.type) {
 *   case RESPONSE_TYPES.ok:
 *     // The withdraw request succeeded, so submit a payment to the network.
 *     // makePayment(withdrawResult);
 *     break;
 *
 *   case RESPONSE_TYPES.interactiveKyc:
 *     // See `fetchKycInBrowser` for additional example code
 *   break;
 *
 *   case RESPONSE_TYPES.nonInteractiveKyc:
 *     // TODO: SEP-12 data submission
 *     break;
 *
 *   case RESPONSE_TYPES.kycStatus:
 *     // The KYC information was previously submitted, but hasn't been approved
 *     // yet. Should show the user the pending status and any supplemental
 *     // information returned
 *     break;
 *
 *   default:
 *     // There was an error.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * There's a helper method for interactive KYC in the browser,
 * `fetchKycInBrowser`, and a helper function for constructing callback URLs for
 * serverside/native apps, `getKycUrl`.

   * [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open).

   * @param {InteractiveKycNeededResponse} options.response The result of
   * starting the withdrawal.
   * @param {window} window A window object created with `window.open()`. This
   * helper will navigate to the correct page, so the window can be empty when
   * you pass it in.
   * @returns {Promise} A promise with the result of the KYC attempt. If it

   * it fails, it will contain information about the KYC failure from the anchor.
